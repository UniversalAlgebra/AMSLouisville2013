\section{Representations of Monk Algebras}

{
A \emph{relation algebra} is an abstract algebra $\langle A,+,\cdot,^-,;,^\cup,1')$ satisfying several equational axioms.

\bigskip

An algebra $\underline{A}$ is \emph{representable} if there is an embedding $\underline{A}\rightarrow \langle P(E),\cup,\cap,^c,|,^{-1},Id\rangle$, where $E$ is some non-empty equivalence relation.  The class RRA of representable algebras is a non-finitely based variety.

{
A \emph{Monk algebra} (or Maddux algebra or Ramsey algebra) is a finite symmetric algebra with atoms $1',a_1,\ldots,a_n$ so that $$a_i;a_i=\overline{a_i}$$

and for $i\neq j$,
 $$a_i;a_j=0'=\overline{1'}.$$

equivalent characterization:
the only forbidden cycles of atoms (triangles) are the 1-cycles $a_ia_ia_i$ (monochromatic triangles)

\section{Weak representations of Monk algebras}

Let wRRA denote the class of weakly representable algebras.
\begin{itemize}
  \item wRRA is a variety (Pesci 2009)
  \pause
  \item wRRA is not finitely based (Hodkinson-Mikulas 2000)
  \pause
  \item RRA is not finitely based over wRRA (Andreka 1994)

\begin{thm}[A., Hirsch 2013]
   Let $\Sigma$ be an equational basis defining RRA over wRRA.  Then $\forall N\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ there is an equation $\varepsilon\in\Sigma$ with more than $N$ distinct variables.


\end{thm}

\pause
   Idea: Construct arbitrarily large weakly representable but not representable algebras whose ``small" subalgebras are all representable.
}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\frame
{
Proof sketch:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Suppose all equations in $\Sigma$ have at most $N$ distinct variables.
  \pause
  \item Consider $M(n),\, n>2^{N+2}$.
  \item Split one atom into $k=R_n(3)$ parts to ensure non-representability, get $M(n,k)$.
  \pause
  \item $M(n,k)$ is weakly representable (1-pt extension)
  \pause
  \item Any subalgebra $S$ generated by $N$ or fewer elements must have an atom $a$ that is above two or more ``unsplit" atoms.  Hence $a$ is flexible.
  \pause
  \item $S$ is representable over a countable set.
  \pause
  \item Hence $S \models\varepsilon$ for all such $S$.
  \item Therefore $M(n,k)\models \varepsilon$, and so $\Sigma$ cannot define RRA over wRRA.
\end{itemize}

{Future work:
Does wRRA have a finite-variable basis?  Presumably not.

\bigskip

Lyndon algebras from projective lines may decide the question.
